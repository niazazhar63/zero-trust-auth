            Explore the future of secure authentication with our Zero Trust Auth system. 
            This project demonstrates a modern approach to digital security, 
            ensuring that every user, device, and access request is continuously verified. 
            Dive in to see how risk-based access, multi-level authentication, 
            and intelligent security checks come together in a real-world application.

            This thesis project demonstrates a dynamic Zero Trust Authentication system. 
            It continuously evaluates every login attempt based on risk factors like device, location, and behavior. 
            For low-risk users, access is seamless; for medium-risk attempts, an OTP verification is triggered; 
            and high-risk attempts are temporarily blocked to prevent unauthorized access. 
            The system reacts in real-time, ensuring security while adapting to each userâ€™s behavior.
